# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 24: June 19

**Today's Progress**: Brilliant: continued Python course

**Thoughts**: The third input to range is the step size â€” how many numbers to jump in between each loop. For i in range(5,50,5)

### Day 23: June 18

**Today's Progress**: Brilliant: started data storage course

**Thoughts**:

### Day 22: June 17

**Today's Progress**: Brilliant: completed Computer Science Fundamentals. Started Python.

### Day 21: June 16

**Today's Progress**: Brilliant: order and search; using resources

**Thoughts** cache = temporarily store information close, for quick retrieval. Memory is a "space" resource. Other resources: time, money, energy

### Day 20: June 15

**Today's Progress**: Started "Brilliant" computer science course

**Thoughts**

**Thoughts** 

### Day 15: May 20

**Today's Progress**: Replit python Day 25

**Thoughts** 

{MISSED 4 DAYS}

### Day 14: May 15

**Today's Progress**: Replit python Day 24, continued with Scratch game

**Thoughts** The terms subroutine and function are used interchangably in python. You define a function with def [name] (parameter1, parameter2)

------------------------------

### Day 0: April 23, 2023 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Replit python first 6 "days". Started CS50 Week 1

**Thoughts:** Several courses in mind: finish Galvanize, the youtube-based python one, CS50, CS224N
C as a low-level language
Project idea: program "gauge the room" as a computer game. Can be played asyncronously. But it's better in person.
Transistors: on represent binary 1, off represent binary 0
byte = 8 bits
ASCII maps between numbers and English letters - A = 65 = 01000001
Unicode includes all human languages & emojis

### Day 3: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Replit python day 10

**Thoughts**  Remember int() for whole numbers, float() for numbers with decimals, round(number, 2) to round to 2 decimal places

CS50 lecture: Think of arguments as inputs! In the mental model:
Input -> Algorithm -> Output

Scratch project idea: A ball that bounces around the screen (like Windows screensaver), leaves a train behind it to create a pattern and/or plays specific tones depending on where it makes contact with the perimeter. The perimeter can also be other shapes than a rectangle.
