# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 23, 2023 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Replit python first 6 "days". Started CS50 Week 1

**Thoughts:** Several courses in mind: finish Galvanize, the youtube-based python one, CS50, CS224N
C as a low-level language
Project idea: program "gauge the room" as a computer game. Can be played asyncronously. But it's better in person.
Transistors: on represent binary 1, off represent binary 0
byte = 8 bits
ASCII maps between numbers and English letters - A = 65 = 01000001
Unicode includes all human languages & emojis
