# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 23, 2023 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Replit python first 6 "days". Started CS50 Week 1

**Thoughts:** Several courses in mind: finish Galvanize, the youtube-based python one, CS50, CS224N
C as a low-level language
Project idea: program "gauge the room" as a computer game. Can be played asyncronously. But it's better in person.
Transistors: on represent binary 1, off represent binary 0
byte = 8 bits
ASCII maps between numbers and English letters - A = 65 = 01000001
Unicode includes all human languages & emojis

### Day 3: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Replit python day 10

**Thoughts**  Remember int() for whole numbers, float() for numbers with decimals, round(number, 2) to round to 2 decimal places

CS50 lecture: Think of arguments as inputs! In the mental model:
Input -> Algorithm -> Output

Scratch project idea: A ball that bounces around the screen (like Windows screensaver), leaves a train behind it to create a pattern and/or plays specific tones depending on where it makes contact with the perimeter. The perimeter can also be other shapes than a rectangle.
